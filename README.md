This project analyzes a dataset of used cars from Ebay Kleinanzeigen, a German online classifieds marketplace. The dataset contains 50,000 data points, with 20 columns of information on various attributes of each car.

Data cleaning and exploration were conducted to prepare the dataset for analysis. The cleaning process involved dropping unnecessary columns, converting text values to numerical values, and removing outliers. The exploration process revealed interesting insights into the distribution of car prices and mileage across different car brands, as well as trends in car registrations and ad creation.

Key findings from the analysis include:

    Volkswagen is the most popular car brand in the dataset, followed by Opel and BMW.
    The most expensive car brand on average is "Sonstige Autos," while the least expensive is Renault.
    The brand with the highest mean mileage is "Audi," while the brand with the lowest mean mileage is "Sonstige Autos."
    The majority of the cars in the dataset were registered between the years 1995 and 1998.
    The most common registration years in the dataset are between 1995 and 1998, with 1998 being the highest year with around 22.5% and 1994 being the lowest with 6%.

This project can be used as a reference for data cleaning and exploration techniques on similar datasets. The code used in this analysis is available in the Jupyter Notebook file provided in this repository.
